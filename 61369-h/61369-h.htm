<p class="poem">
  How jolly are the dwarfs, the little ones, the Mexicans<br />
  Hidden by the singing of wind through sugar-cane,<br />
  Out comes the pretty one,<br />
  Out comes the ugly one,<br />
  Out comes the dwarf with the wicked smile and thin.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The little women caper and simper and flutter fans,<br />
  The little men laugh, stamp, strut and stamp again,<br />
  Dance to the bag-pipe drone,<br />
  Of insect semitone,<br />
  Swelling from ground slashed with light like zebra skin.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The little Cardinal, the humming-bird, whose feathers flare<br />
  Like flame across the valley of volcanic stone,<br />
  Fiery arrow from a rainbow<br />
  That the armoured plants have slain, low<br />
  Stoops to watch the dwarfs as they dance out of sight.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Hair, long and black as jet, is floating yet on amber air<br />
  Honey-shaded by the shadow of Popacatapetl's cone,<br />
  Their fluttering reboses<br />
  Like purple-petal'd roses<br />
  Fall through tropic din with a clatter of light.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The crooked dwarf now ripples the strings of a mandoline,<br />
  His floating voice has wings that brush us like a butterfly;<br />
  Music fills the mountains<br />
  With a riot of fountains<br />
  That spray back on the hot plain like a waterfall.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Smaller grow the dwarfs, singing "I'll bring shoes of satin,"<br />
  Smaller they grow, fade to golden motes, then die.<br />
  Where is the pretty one,<br />
  Where is the ugly one,<br />
  Where is that tongue of flame, the little Cardinal?<br />

<p class="poem">
  The Mexican dwarfs can dance for miles<br />
  Stamping their feet and scattering smiles,<br />
  Till the loud hills laugh and laugh again<br />
  At the dancing dwarfs in the golden plain,<br />
  Till the bamboos sing as the dwarfs dance by,<br />
  Kicking their feet at a jagged sky,<br />
  That torn by leaves and gashed by hills<br />
  Rocks to the rhythm the hot sun shrills;<br />
  The bubble sun stretches shadows that pass<br />
  To noiseless jumping-jacks of glass,<br />
  So long and thin, so silent and opaque,<br />
  That the lions shake their orange manes, and quake;<br />
  And a shadow that leaps over Popacatapetl<br />
  Terrifies the tigers as they settle<br />
  Cat-like limbs, cut with golden bars,<br />
  Under bowers of flowers that shimmer like stars.<br />
  Buzzing of insects flutters above,<br />
  Shaking the rich trees' treasure-trove<br />
  Till the fruit rushes down like a comet, whose tail<br />
  Thrashes the night with its golden flail,<br />
  The fruit hisses down with a plump from its tree<br />
  Like the singing of a rainbow as it dips into the sea.<br />
  Loud red trumpets of great blossoms blare<br />
  Triumphantly like heralds who blow a fanfare,<br />
  Till the humming-bird, bearing heaven on its wing,<br />
  Flies from the terrible blossoming,<br />
  And the humble honey-bee is frightened by the fine<br />
  Honey that is heavy like money and purple like wine,<br />
  While birds that flaunt their pinions like pennons<br />
  Shriek from their trees of oranges and lemons,<br />
  And the scent rises up in a cloud, to make<br />
  The hairy, swinging monkeys feel so weak<br />
  That they each throw down a bitten coconut or mango.<br />

  Up flames a flamingo over the fandango,<br />
  Glowing like a fire, and gleaming like a ruby.<br />
  From Guadalajara to Guadalupe<br />
  It flies&mdash;in flying drops a feather<br />
  ... And the snatching dwarfs stop dancing&mdash;and fight together.<br />

  OUT OF THE FLAME<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  From my high window,<br />
  From my high window in a southern city,<br />
  I peep through the slits of the shutters,<br />
  Whose steps of light<br />
  Span darkness like a ladder.<br />
  Throwing wide the shutters<br />
  I let the streets into the silent room<br />
  With sudden clatter;<br />
  Walk out upon the balcony<br />
  Whose curving irons are bent<br />
  Like bows about to shoot&mdash;<br />
  Bows from which the mortal arrows<br />
  Cast from dark eyes, dark-lashed<br />
  And shadowed by mantillas,<br />
  Shall in the evening<br />
  Rain down upon men's hearts<br />
  Paraded here, in southern climes,<br />
  More openly.<br />
  But, at this early moment of the day,<br />
  The balconies are empty;<br />
  Only the sun, still drowsy-fingered,<br />
  Plucks, pizzicato, at the rails,<br />
  Draws out of them faint music<br />
  Of rain-washed air,<br />
  Or, when each bell lolls out its idiot tongue,<br />
  When Time lets drop his cruel scythe,<br />
  They sing in sympathy.<br />
  The sun, then, plucks these irons,<br />
  As far below,<br />
  That child<br />
  Draws his stick along the railings.<br />
  The sound of it brings my eye down to him....<br />
  Oh heart, dry heart,<br />
  It is yourself again!<br />
  How nearly are we come together!<br />
  If, at this moment,<br />
  One long ribbon was unfurled<br />
  From me to him,<br />
  I should be shown<br />
  Above, in a straight line&mdash;<br />
  A logical growth,<br />
  And yet,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wave, but he will not look up;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call, but he will not answer.<br />

<p class="poem">
  From where I stand<br />
  The beauty of the early morning<br />
  Suffocates me;<br />
  It is as if fingers closed round my heart.<br />
  The light flows down the hills in rivulets,<br />
  So you could gather it up in the cup of your hands,<br />
  While pools,<br />
  The cold eyes of the gods,<br />
  Are cradled in those hollows.<br />
  Cool are the clouds,<br />
  Anchored in the heaven;<br />
  Green as ice are they,<br />
  To temper the heat in the valleys<br />
  With arches of violet shadow.<br />
  You can hear from the distant woods<br />
  The thud of the centaurs' hoofs<br />
  As they gallop down to drink,<br />
  Shatter the golden roofs<br />
  Of the trees, for swift as the wind<br />
  They gallop down to the brink<br />
  Of the waters that echo their laughter,<br />
  Cavernous as rolling of boulders down hills;<br />
  Lolling, they lap at the gurgling waters.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  * * * * *<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But nearer rises the sound,<br />
  Red, ragged as his comb,<br />
  Of a cock crowing;<br />
  A bird flies up to me at the window,<br />
  Leaping, like music, with regular rhythm,<br />
  Sinks down, then, to the city beneath.<br />

  Below, the ants are hurrying down the footways,<br />
  Dressed, here, in bright colours.<br />
  Under their various intolerable burdens<br />
  They stagger along.<br />
  Stop to converse, move, wave their antennæ.<br />

<p class="poem">
  The fruit-seller is opening his stall,<br />
  Oranges are piled in minute pyramids,<br />
  While melons, green melons,<br />
  Swing from the roof in string cradles.<br />
  The butcher festoons his shop<br />
  With swags and gay wreaths of entrails;<br />
  Beautiful heads with horns,<br />
  Are nailed up, as on pagan altars,<br />
  (Though their ears are fresh from the hearing<br />
  Of Orpheus playing his lute).<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The Aguador arranges his glasses,<br />
  Out of which the sun will strike<br />
  His varying scales of crystal music<br />
  This afternoon, round the arena.<br />
  The Matador prepares for the fight,<br />
  Is, indeed, already in the Tavern,<br />
  Where later and refreshed with blood,<br />
  He will celebrate his triumph<br />
  Among the poignant kindling<br />
  Of stringéd instruments.<br />

<p class="poem">
  The chatter of the daylight grows<br />
  As I look upon the market-place,<br />
  Where there is a droning of bag-pipes,<br />
  And the hard, wooden music of the hills;<br />
  The housewife has left her cottage in the forest,<br />
  Driving here through the early tracks of the sun.<br />
  The beggars are already at their posts,<br />
  Their dry flesh peeps through their garments.<br />
  Their old ritual whining<br />
  Causes no show of pity.<br />
  Why should the hucksters, the busy people notice?<br />
  God himself has stood here, out at elbows,<br />
  Waiting patiently in the market-place,<br />
  While they chatter in gay booths.<br />
  But how I fear for them,<br />
  These who are not afraid!<br />
  I shout to them to make them understand.<br />
  They talk more, cease talking and look up,<br />
  They all look up, remain gaping.<br />

  I went back into the water-cool room,<br />
  Put on my coloured coat, my buskin,<br />
  And mask of Harlequin.<br />
  They see me, this time.<br />
  "Come on, come on," they cry,<br />
  "You are just in time.<br />
  There is fun down here in the market-place.<br />
  Two men have been run over,<br />
  And there's to be a public execution.<br />
  The gallows are nearly up.<br />
  &mdash;And after, in the evening,<br />
  We will go round the wineshops,<br />
  Strumming guitars,<br />
  While trills Dolores in her wide, red skirt.<br />
  Oh come on, come on!"<br />

  And dyes my clothing.<br />

  It is not thus in the Northern cities,<br />
  Where the cold breathes close to the window-pane,<br />
  Where the brittle flowers of the frost<br />
  Crackle at the window's edge.<br />
  From my window in the Northern city<br />
  I can hear the rattle and roar of the town,<br />
  As the carts go lumbering over the bridges,<br />
  As the men in dark clothes hurry over the bridges.<br />
  They do not parade their hearts here,<br />
  They bury them at their lives' beginning.<br />
  They must hurry, or they will be late for their work;<br />
  Their work is their bread.<br />
  Without bread, how can they work?<br />
  They have no time for pleasure,<br />
  Nor is work any pleasure to them.<br />
  Their faces are masked with weariness,<br />
  Drab with their working.<br />
  (Only the tramp who moves among them<br />
  Unnoticed, despised,<br />
  Has eyes that have seen).<br />
  They must work till the guns go again,<br />
  Giving them their only pretence to glory.<br />
  They have no time to fear,<br />
  No time to think of an end.<br />
  Foolishly I called to them on the bridges;<br />
  Only a few stopped, looked up<br />
  &mdash;But these were convulsed with fury.<br />
  Said one to another<br />
  "I have never seen a man<br />
  Behave like that before."<br />
  But most of them were mute,<br />

  WHEN SOLOMON MET THE QUEEN OF SHEBA<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The navy at Ezion-Geba<br />
  Gazed across the water amazed;<br />
  When Solomon met the Queen of Sheba<br />
  Lions in the desert were dazed<br />
  With wonder at her striped pavilion<br />
  That blazed like a new parhelion;<br />
  They roared their admiration<br />
  At this strange coruscation<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the satyrs<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took their tawny children<br />

  To march with the procession, to march with the band.<br />
  The flaming phoenix flew with its feathers to fan<br />
  The Queen at the head of her caravan;<br />
  But, the phoenix, though famously fabulous,<br />
  Was jealous, envious, and emulous<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Queen of Sheba had a retinue<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strictly in keeping with her revenue&mdash;<br />
  Six thousand camels and camelopards<br />
  Ten thousand and ninety nigger bodyguards.<br />
  The camelopards, proud-necked and tall<br />
  Would scarcely deign to notice the Queen at all,<br />
  But holding their heads as high as zebras<br />
  Looked down on a hundred dwarf, harnessed zebras<br />
  Bred for their stripes, with such success<br />
  That the Queen could play a game of chess<br />
  When travelling.  The camels kneel<br />
  Offer their humps for the Queen to feel,<br />
  Nodding arched-necks and plumes of ostrich-feather,<br />
  Dyed like her bright Abyssinian weather.<br />
  The ten thousand niggers beat on gourds and golden gongs,<br />
  Slashing the air with their piebald songs.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">

  Each sweet-smelling branch bore a budding bell of gold<br />
  (Oh! the blood of Israelites ran cold...)<br />
  When evening-wind blurred the hills with blue<br />
  The swinging and the singing of the bells sang true,<br />
  These by some magic stratagem<br />
  Played the Sheban National Anthem,<br />
  While the trill of each bell was like an Abyssinian bird,<br />
  Or the golden voice of the Queen&mdash;for each word<br />
  She spoke, trembled, sparkled in the air,<br />
  Then spread its wings, and flew from her.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Queen of Sheba went with Solomon<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his country house at Lebanon.<br />

<p class="poem">
  She did not bring him any cedar trees<br />
  For these<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would have been de-trop.<br />
  Instead she brought him some Pekoe-trees<br />
  In a beautiful Chinese bowl<br />
  (For she had a very marked objection to<br />
  Endowing Newcastle with coal)<br />
  And she brought him gifts of hot-house grapes,<br />
  Of ivory,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ebony,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of elephants and apes,<br />
  Of peacocks, of pearls, and a hundred pygmy slaves<br />
  With skins like an orange, and hair that waves,<br />
  And each of them wore a turban,<br />
  Picked out with the plumes of a pelican,<br />
  But of all her gifts, by far the rarest,<br />
  Brought from the terrible central forest,<br />
  With a vein of gold in its ivory horn,<br />
  Was a lovelorn<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Milk-white unicorn;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the King, though sweet as honey,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had an eye for the value of money,<br />

<p class="poem">
  Asleep, asleep with closéd eyes<br />
  In the womb of time, King Pharaoh lies;<br />
  Heavy the darkness is, as rust,<br />
  On the cold sword he holds; while dust<br />
  Muffles the mocking panoply<br />
  With quilted silence, dead and grey.<br />
  Here any wandering sound would skim<br />
  The sleep off silence, to wake him<br />
  Till under the too-smooth mask of gold<br />
  Old parchment wrinkles would unfold,<br />
  His green and ice-bound limbs expand,<br />
  The dead flowers blossom in dead hand;<br />
  But comes no sound, save the flitting scowl<br />
  Of death-winged bat, or vault-voiced owl,<br />
  No sound through the ages all forlorn,<br />
  Unless a padding unicorn<br />
  Obscures his treasure, ivory white,<br />
  In the Egyptian grape-blue night;<br />
  Curling his limbs to rest, untangles<br />
  His milky mane, while moon-sharp angles<br />
  Of pyramids enfold him close<br />
  In their defiant, calm repose&mdash;<br />
  For their harsh angularity<br />
  Defeats the hunter's cruelty....<br />

  While out of the golden sockets came<br />

  He dashed the gold mask on the floor,<br />
  His dry limbs creaked toward the door,<br />

<h3>

</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Silenus left the mainland<br />
  On a floating barrel of wine,<br />
  His sail was plaited from peach-leaves, and<br />
  The leaves of the fig and vine.<br />
  Small waves seemed masks of laughter<br />
  As they rose at Silenus agape,<br />
  For his feet were purple with the slaughter<br />
  And the crushing of the Phoenix-blooded grape.<br />
  But the little golden winds of the autumn<br />
  Flew with him all the way,<br />
  Like a fleecy flock of Seraphim<br />
  They waited on him all the day&mdash;<br />
  When the Syren swam to sing to him<br />
  From her island where the dolphins play,<br />
  They pelted her with lemons and with persimmon<br />
  Till the Syren dived away.<br />
  They blew down silver trumpets to summon<br />
  Sea-monsters that peer from the spray.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But the sound of seraphic hunting-horn<br />
  Brayed to the nearing golden strand,<br />
  Till each ogre, dragon, giant and unicorn<br />
  Sprang from his cave, to guard his land<br />
  &mdash;This dear, dear land of Venus<br />
  Where the hippogriff and griffin play!<br />
  For if the Syren sang to Silenus<br />
  What would Jealous Venus say?<br />

<p class="poem">
  The Syren's voice, like a golden bee,<br />

  It brought Silenus a message of love;<br />
  But, as, rather helpless, he heard the Syren's song<br />
  He felt that his behaviour was material&mdash;was wrong,<br />
  He tore the tinted vine-leaves from his tousled hair<br />
  Shouted for his satellites, dragged them from their lair,<br />
  Mentioned, most severely, the iniquities of drink<br />
  (Though his speech came thick and indistinct);<br />
  But his followers were angry, woken out of sleep,<br />
  Recalled to him that the sea was deep,<br />
  That if it was water he really would prefer,<br />
  And the singing of the Syren, he could go to look for her!<br />
  But, Silenus, though pink and fat,<br />
  Was strong, for the matter of that...<br />
  He fought like a lion, and bellowed like a seal,<br />
  But he had filled his followers with missionary zeal,<br />
  They swung him high, and swung him low,<br />
  Then threw him (plomp) where the salt waves blow.<br />
  The syren stopped her singing at a piteous cry,<br />
  Saw a spout of water mounting hundreds of feet high,<br />
  And Jonah aboard a neighbouring sail,<br />
  Sang "Yo-ho, yo-ho, I spy a whale!"<br />

<p class="poem">
  Through the green masses of the undergrowth,<br />
  Pools of silent water,<br />
  Where float large flowers and patches of white light,<br />
  Crawls the serpent, subtle, sad,<br />
  And tired of well-doing.<br />
  Nevermore will he help humanity.<br />
  Venomously he hisses at the Cherubim<br />
  Whose flaming sword sears the Heavens,<br />
  A sword whose flame turns every way<br />
  To keep the path of the Tree-of-Life.<br />
  A tropic spring, this first one,<br />
  With leaves like spears and banners;<br />
  But the ground is sweet with fallen petals<br />
  Of great blossoms<br />
  That heave their hot breath at the droning insects.<br />
  The air is full of the twittering of birds,<br />
  Whose innocence appeals to Adam<br />
  &mdash;Already outside the garden&mdash;<br />
  While, high up in their swaying green cradles<br />
  The monkeys carry on their high-pitched chatter.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The serpent reasoned thus&mdash;<br />
  "For long time have I been at war<br />

  Small apes with clutching hands,<br />
  Great apes (how hideous they are!)<br />
  Whom the God-of-Man<br />
  Has made in the image of Man.<br />
  They tried to kill me:<br />
  I tried to kill them.<br />
  But Adam and Eve deceived me,<br />
  Looking scornfully at the great apes,<br />
  They pretended to a difference.<br />
  For a long time I loved them,<br />
  Fascinated by their words,<br />
  By their story of the Creation&mdash;<br />
  But now, O Lord,<br />
  Give me a good old-fashioned ape<br />
  Every time<br />
  &mdash;An ape who tries to kill me<br />
  Without a chatter of clean-hands, law-and-order,<br />
  Crime passionel,<br />
  Self-defence or helping-me-to-help-myself.<br />
  I may be a snake in the grass,<br />
  But I am not a hypocrite.<br />
  I may change my skin,<br />
  But I am not ashamed of it.<br />
  I have never pretended to be a super-snake<br />
  Or to walk except on my belly&mdash;<br />

  * * * * *<br />

<p class="poem">
  It is not only the ignorance of good or evil<br />
  That raises the monkey above the man<br />
  (Though the man knows evil and therefore prefers it),<br />
  But the fact that the monkey<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words shall girdle a continent<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For millions of men to read<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;But they will still be lies&mdash;black lies!<br />

  Magic for a holy race<br />

<p class="poem">
  Though Gentile Kings upon their thrones<br />
  May weave a spell, or dance like Tich,<br />

<p class="poem">
  Now Mrs. Freudenthal has heard her call<br />
  Without a qualm&mdash;yet how can she obey<br />
  The bidding of the prophetess (like Saul,<br />
  She has consulted Endor)?  How can she<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Aspire to feed the lions, yet unlike Daniel,<br />
  Once there insist on resting in their den,<br />
  To treat them as one would a King Charles Spaniel<br />
  With frowns&mdash;with bones and biscuits, now and then?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  For Mrs. Freudenthal is weary of<br />

<p class="poem">
  Money is power&mdash;a golden pedestal<br />

  Thus Mrs. Freudenthal, alone, awake,<br />

  THE MANNER<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Allow no personality to stamp<br />
  Its wayward lines upon your talk or dress;<br />
  Smooth out your facial furrows, on them clamp<br />
  The necessary look of nothingness.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  You must acquire a careful conversation<br />
  Remember that War-horses of True Breed<br />
  Only feel interest&mdash;if ever&mdash;in relation<br />
  To other ones&mdash;and, never, never read!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Know though the names of authors, and conceivably<br />
  The names of their most fashionable book;<br />
  But never talk too far, or irretrievably<br />
  You blunder on the crafty fisher's hook.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then music, as a rule, you love too well<br />
  To wish to hear.  But if you go, you walk<br />
  About&mdash;if not too loud, it helps to swell<br />
  The frankly social impulse toward talk.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  You simply love the Opera, and force<br />
  Your way in late, and romp from cage to cage;<br />
  The prima-donna is a well-known War-horse<br />
  Who fills the heart, the ear, the house, the stage!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  If you see modern pictures, in their glass<br />
  Ecstatically examine the old strife<br />
  Between your food and figure&mdash;should he pass,<br />
  Discuss with friends the painter's private life.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Though, safety-first, you find it really best<br />
  To cast your rapture on the gilded air,<br />
  When you find pictures dead, but smartly drest,<br />
  Within the mansion of a millionaire.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Still you encourage those whom you can hire<br />
  To fix on canvas, for the future race<br />
  Of War-horses to simper at&mdash;admire,<br />
  The painted image of your painted face.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And any artist, author, or musician,<br />
  &mdash;If second-rate&mdash;is useful as a bait<br />
  To fish for guests&mdash;remember words like "Titian"<br />
  "&mdash;Shakespeare" "&mdash;Mozart," let go&mdash;and trust to Fate<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  To pull you through&mdash;avoid ideas&mdash;they're common<br />

<p class="poem">
  So, now, swooped darkness down; outside, each lamp<br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
  Within, exposed a section harsh and shrill<br />
  Of life, cut off as the next scene succeeded<br />

<p class="poem">
  Flashes its image on the world's dark screen<br />

  Yet silent, the unwelcome harmony<br />
  May cause the facial scaffolding to fall;<br />
  They lower safety-curtains o'er each eye,<br />

<p class="poem">
  For music has a strange, unwelcome power<br />

  I.  THE GENERAL'S WIFE REFUSES<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  It isn't that I don't like them,<br />
  My dear Mrs. Kinfoot,<br />
  But I know<br />
  I am not clever,<br />
  And I like your old friends best.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  As for the General<br />
  He disapproves of Art,<br />
  And does not believe in it.<br />
  He has noticed<br />
  That Artists<br />
  Have an odd look in their eyes,<br />
  And a shifty expression.<br />
  In fact,<br />
  The General disapproves of Art.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  He finds that Artists<br />
  Are stupid<br />
  And difficult to talk to&mdash;<br />
  He remembers meeting one<br />
  In '97<br />
  Who was not interested<br />
  In Polo,<br />
  &mdash;And appeared<br />
  To be unaware of the existence<br />
  Of the old Duke of Cambridge.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  My husband didn't get angry,<br />
  He just said to him, like that,<br />
  "What are you interested in?<br />
  <i>ART</i>, I suppose?"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In spite of this<br />
  The General thinks<br />
  That music is more dangerous<br />
  &mdash;And subversive of discipline<br />
  Than painting&mdash;<br />
  For&mdash;in painting&mdash;<br />
  That is to say<br />
  In good painting&mdash;<br />
  You can see put down on canvas<br />
  What you can see yourself&mdash;<br />
  &mdash;And you can touch it<br />
  With your finger&mdash;<br />
  A picture should be the same<br />
  As a coloured photograph,<br />
  Except that the camera<br />
  Reveals things<br />
  Invisible to the Human Eye;<br />
  That is wrong!<br />
  (By the Human Eye<br />
  The General says<br />
  He means<br />
  His own eye)<br />
  But in Music<br />
  You can see nothing,<br />
  And you are unable<br />
  To touch it<br />
  With your fingers;<br />
  The General disapproves of Art,<br />
  &mdash;But it makes him positively nervous<br />
  To hear music.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The General says that,<br />
  As far as he can make out,<br />
  All musicians<br />
  Have been German&mdash;<br />
  But he can only remember<br />
  The name of one&mdash;<br />
  Nietzsche!<br />
  As the war<br />
  Was German in origin,<br />
  It is obvious that it was made<br />
  By German Composers<br />
  And <i>not</i><br />
  By German Generals<br />
  &mdash;Many of whom were fine fellows<br />
  Who loved a good joke.<br />
  The General remembers one<br />
  Who laughed like anything<br />
  At one of his stories.<br />
  The war was made by German musicians<br />
  &mdash;Just as surely<br />
  As our own<br />
  Pacific and imaginative policy<br />
  Was interpreted<br />
  By Kipling and Lady Butler.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Never trust a Man<br />
  Who plays the piano,"<br />
  The General says.<br />
  He thinks that<br />
  In the main,<br />
  The British have a sound interest<br />
  In this matter.<br />
  Probably Charles I,<br />
  Played the piano&mdash;<br />
  And, at any rate,<br />
  He collected Pictures.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The English would never<br />
  Behead anyone<br />
  For governing badly;<br />
  It is only Barbarians,<br />
  Like the Russians,<br />
  Who would do this.<br />
  The General<br />
  Disapproves of Art.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But, of all these things,<br />
  The General says<br />
  He dislikes poetry most,<br />
  Kipling is different;<br />
  He is a Man-of-the-World.<br />
  But the General says<br />
  That if he got hold<br />
  Of one of these long-haired<br />
  Conscientious Objectors,<br />
  Who write things<br />
  Which don't even rhyme<br />
  He'd&mdash;&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see, dear,<br />
  That it's better for us<br />
  Not to come.<br />

  Petunias in mass formation,<br />
  An angry rose, a hard carnation,<br />
  Hot yellow grass, a yellow palm<br />
  Rising, giraffe-like, into calm<br />
  &mdash;All these glare hotly in the sun.<br />
  Behind are woods, where shadows run<br />
  Like water through the dripping shade<br />
  That leaves and laughing wind have made.<br />
  Here silence, like a silver bird,<br />
  Pecks at the fruit-ripe heat.  We heard<br />
  Townward, the voices, glazed with starch,<br />
  Of Tourists on belated march<br />
  From church to church, to praise by rule<br />
  The beauties of the Tuscan school,<br />
  Clanging of trams, a hidden flute,<br />
  Sharp as the taste of unripe fruit;<br />
  Street organs join with tolling bell<br />
  To threaten us with both Heaven and Hell,<br />
  But through all taps a nearing sound<br />
  As of stage-horses pawing ground.<br />
  Then like a whale, confined in cage,<br />
  (In grandeur of a borrowed carriage)<br />
  The old Marchesa swam in sight<br />
  In tinkling jet that caught the light,<br />
  Making the sun hit out each tone<br />
  As if it played a xylophone,<br />
  Till she seems like a rainbow, where<br />
  She swells, and whale-like, spouts the air.<br />

  Each child, each tree, the shrilling heat<br />
  Became encased in glacial jet,<br />
  The very songbird in the air<br />

  Within the sunny greenness of the close,<br />
  Secure, a heavy breathing fell, then rose&mdash;<br />
  Here undulating chins sway to and fro,<br />
  As heavy blossoms do; the cheek's faint glow<br />
  Points to post-prandial port.  The willow weeps<br />
  Hushed are the birds&mdash;in fact&mdash;the Bishop sleeps.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Then, suddenly, the wide sky blazes red;<br />
  Up from their graves arise the solemn dead,<br />
  The world is shaken; buildings fall in twain,<br />
  Exulting hills shout loud, then shout again<br />
  While, with the thunder of deep rolling drums<br />
  The angels sing&mdash;&mdash;  At last Salvation comes.<br />
  The weak, the humble, the disdained, the poor<br />
  Are judged the first, and climb to Heaven's door.<br />

  From bone-built palaces.<br />
  Gold flowed like blood<br />
  Through the streets;<br />
  Crowds became drunk<br />
  On liquor distilled from corpses.<br />
  And peering down<br />
  The Son of Man looked into the world;<br />
  He saw<br />
  That within the churches and the temples<br />
  His image had been set up;<br />
  But, from time to time,<br />
  Through twenty centuries,<br />
  The priests had touched up the countenance<br />
  So as to make war more easy<br />
  Or intimidate the people&mdash;<br />
  Until now the face<br />
  Had become the face of Moloch!<br />
  The people did not notice<br />
  The change<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
